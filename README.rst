My Dotfiles
===========

Harder, better, faster, stronger configuration files for my console applications.

.vimrc
------

Copy the `vimrc` file into your `/home/<user/.vimrc` file and clone *Vundle*:

    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Then, inside your .vimrc file, run:

    :PluginInstall
